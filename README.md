## Abstract

Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMDs) lose the visibility of virtual contents under bright environment illumination due to their see-through nature. We demonstrate how liquid crystal (LC) filters attached to an OST-HMD work for increasing the perceived brightness of virtual contents without impacting the brightness of the real scene. In our psychophysical experiments in three scenes, participants were asked to compare the magnitude of brightness changes of both real and virtual objects, before and after dimming the LC filter. The results show that the participants felt increases in the brightness of virtual objects while they were less conscious of reductions of the real scene luminance.

**Figure** (a) Our prototype Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display (OST-HMD) increases the \textit{perceived} brightness of virtual objects in bright conditions by dynamically adjusting liquid crystal (LC) shutters according to the measured brightness of the environment. (b) The virtual teapot appears consistent with the background in a dark environment. (c) On the other hand, it appears transparent and dim in a bright environment. (d) By gradually adjusting the transparency of the LC shutters, the teapot is perceived as  brighter, while the background is perceived as unchanged. Images (b), (c), and (d) were captured directly through our prototype with a PointGrey Flea3 camera with automatic shutter speed. We present psychophysics experiments validating that users indeed perceive an improvement akin to the difference between (c) and (d).
